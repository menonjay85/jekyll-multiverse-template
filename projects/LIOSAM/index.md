        title: "Overview"
        body: "LIO-SAM is a state-of-the-art algorithm that integrates LiDAR and IMU data to perform real-time odometry and mapping. It is particularly effective in environments where GPS signals are weak or unavailable, such as indoors or in urban canyons. The algorithm employs factor graph optimization to fuse data from the LiDAR and IMU sensors, ensuring robust and accurate state estimation. LIO-SAM is designed to handle the complexities of dynamic environments and large-scale mapping, making it suitable for various robotic applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and mobile robots.
